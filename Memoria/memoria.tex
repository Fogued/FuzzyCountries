\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and motivation for the study}

At the beginning, when we started thinking about the project, we were looking for a topic that could be both fascinating and challenging, while also fitting well with the principles of fuzzy logic. We aimed to choose a topic applicable to real life, allowing us to draw conclusions that we might not have realized without applying these tools.

At the very first moment, we started thinking about the possibility of focusing on psychological analysis or something related to human mental health because we thought it would be interesting to apply fuzzy logic to this field. However, we quickly realized that this topic was too broad and complex for the scope of our project and also that it would be difficult to find reliable data to work with.

Without giving up on the idea of working with human behavior, we decided to focus on a topic that would allow us to analyze human behavior in a more indirect way. We thought about the possibility of analyzing the relationship between socio-economic and environmental indicators and how these factors can influence the happiness of a country's population. We believe that this topic is relevant and interesting because it allows us to explore the relationship between different aspects of human life and how they can affect people's well-being.

Moreover, this idea of analyzing the happiness of a country's population gives us the opportunity to contrast the results obtained with the World Happiness Report, which is a well-known study that ranks countries based on their happiness levels. This will allow us to validate our results and compare them with those obtained by other researchers, thereby assessing the credibility of this approach.
\subsection{Research objectives}

As mentioned above, the main objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between socio-economic and environmental indicators and the happiness of a country's population. To achieve this, we will develop a fuzzy logic system with functions and rules to model this relationship and draw conclusions from the available data.

We will use data from reputable sources like the World Happiness Report and the World Bank. Our fuzzy logic system, with functions and rules will process this data to reveal patterns and insights that may not be immediately apparent, and we will find the credibility of our results by comparing the happiness scores we obtain with those in the World Happiness Report.


\section{Theorical Framework}

\subsection{Fuzzy Logic}
Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1 both inclusive. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Furthermore, when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions.

\section{Methodology}

The methodology used in this project can be divided into the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data Collection: Collecting data from different sources related to socio-economic and environmental indicators.
	\item Data Description: Describing the data collected and analyzing its characteristics.
	\item Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and integrating the data to make it suitable for analysis.
	\item Database Design and Development: Designing and developing a database to store the data and integrate it with the fuzzy logic system.
	\item Implementation of the Fuzzy System: Developing the fuzzy logic system with functions and rules to model the relationship between the indicators and happiness.
	\item Results and Discussion: Presenting and analyzing the results obtained from the fuzzy logic system.
	\item Challenges and Solutions: Identifying difficulties encountered during the project and proposing solutions to overcome them.
	\item Conclusions and Future Work: Drawing conclusions from the study and suggesting possible future research directions.
\end{enumerate}
