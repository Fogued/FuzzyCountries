\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and motivation for the study}
The motivation for this study comes from the need to better understand and model the complex socioeconomic dynamics of different countries. Traditional economic models often can't handle the uncertainty and vagueness in real-world data. Fuzzy logic theory is well-suited for this task, providing a way to deal with these uncertainties. This study aims to create a more accurate and reliable socioeconomic model, which will be compared with real data to ensure its credibility.

At the beginning, we were looking for a project that could be both fascinating and challenging, while also fitting well with the principles of fuzzy logic. We aimed to choose a topic applicable to real life, allowing us to draw conclusions that we might not have realized without applying these tools.

Initially, we considered focusing on psychological analysis or human mental health, as it seemed an interesting application of fuzzy logic. However, we quickly realized that this topic was too broad and complex for our project's scope and that finding reliable data would be difficult.

Instead, we decided to analyze human behavior in a more indirect way by examining the relationship between socio-economic and environmental indicators and the happiness of a country's population. This topic is relevant and interesting because it explores how different aspects of life affect well-being. Moreover, analyzing the happiness of a country's population allows us to compare our results with the World Happiness Report, a well-known study that ranks countries based on happiness levels. This comparison will help us validate our results and assess the credibility of our approach.
\subsection{Research objectives}
The main objective of this research is to develop a socioeconomic model that provides relevant insights into the economic and environmental conditions of different countries, which traditional models and classical logic cannot achieve. Additionally, the research seeks to use Uflese for visualizing the outcomes, ensuring that the model's findings are both understandable and useful for further analysis. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a credible model that can provide valuable insights into the socioeconomic conditions of various countries that may not be immediately apparent.

To achieve this, we will develop a fuzzy logic system with functions and rules to analyze the relationship between socio-economic and environmental indicators and the happiness of a country's population. We will use data from reputable sources like the World Happiness Report and the World Bank. By comparing the happiness scores we obtain with those in the World Happiness Report, we will validate our results and assess the credibility of our model.
\section{Theorical Framework}

\subsection{Fuzzy Logic}
Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1 both inclusive. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Furthermore, when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions.

\section{Methodology}

The methodology used in this project can be divided into the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data Collection: Collecting data from different sources related to socio-economic and environmental indicators.
	\item Data Description: Describing the data collected and analyzing its characteristics.
	\item Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and integrating the data to make it suitable for analysis.
	\item Database Design and Development: Designing and developing a database to store the data and integrate it with the fuzzy logic system.
	\item Implementation of the Fuzzy System: Developing the fuzzy logic system with functions and rules to model the relationship between the indicators and happiness.
	\item Results and Discussion: Presenting and analyzing the results obtained from the fuzzy logic system.
	\item Challenges and Solutions: Identifying difficulties encountered during the project and proposing solutions to overcome them.
	\item Conclusions and Future Work: Drawing conclusions from the study and suggesting possible future research directions.

%Explanation of the data types used (rfuzzy_string_type, rfuzzy_float_type, etc.).
%Data sources and data integration.
%Validation of the database.

\subsection{Data Collection}
To gather the data, we used a variety of sources (mainly Kaggle) to obtain information on different socio-economic and environmental indicators for various countries.
We analysed which indicators would be most relevant for our study and selected the most reliable and up-to-date datasets available.
Furthermore, we ensured that the data was clean and consistent by performing data cleaning and validation procedures.

First of all, we started by collecting data from different sources. 

\subsection{Data Description}
The variables in the database include a mix of socio-economic and environmental indicators, which are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{high\_economic\_freedom}: Economic Freedom, measured through indexes such as the Index of Economic Freedom.
    \item \textbf{risk\_high\_temperature}: Average Surface Temperature, measured in degrees Celsius.
    \item \textbf{alarming\_suicide\_rate}: Suicide Rate, measured in suicides per 100,000 inhabitants.
    \item \textbf{high\_corruption\_concern}: Perception of Corruption, measured through corruption perception surveys.
    \item \textbf{dangerous\_population\_density}: Population Density, measured in people per square kilometer (P/Km\(^2\)).
    \item \textbf{huge\_agricultural\_land\_percentage}: Agricultural Land, measured as a percentage of total land area.
    \item \textbf{extensive\_surface}: Land Area, measured in square kilometers (Km\(^2\)).
    \item \textbf{strong\_armed\_forces\_rate}: Armed Forces Size, measured by the number of active military personnel.
    \item \textbf{high\_birth\_rate}: Birth Rate, measured in births per 1,000 inhabitants.
    \item \textbf{critical\_co2}: CO2 Emissions, measured in metric tons of CO2 per capita.
    \item \textbf{high\_cpi\_rate}: Consumer Price Index (CPI), measured as an index.
    \item \textbf{high\_fertility\_rate}: Fertility Rate, measured in births per woman.
    \item \textbf{vast\_forested\_area\_percentage}: Forested Area, measured as a percentage of total land area.
    \item \textbf{wealthy\_gdp\_per\_capita}: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), measured in USD per capita.
    \item \textbf{high\_education\_primary}: Gross Primary Education Enrollment, measured as a percentage of the relevant age group.
    \item \textbf{high\_education\_tertiary}: Gross Tertiary Education Enrollment, measured as a percentage of the relevant age group.
    \item \textbf{high\_infant\_mortality\_rate}: Infant Mortality Rate, measured in deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births.
    \item \textbf{long\_life\_expectancy}: Life Expectancy, measured in years.
    \item \textbf{big\_population\_size}: Population Size, measured in number of inhabitants.
    \item \textbf{numerous\_active\_workers}: Labor Force Participation, measured as a percentage of the working-age population.
    \item \textbf{high\_tax\_revenue\_percentage}: Tax Revenue, measured as a percentage of GDP.
    \item \textbf{significant\_population\_unemployed}: Unemployment Rate, measured as a percentage of the labor force.

    \item \textbf{abundant\_renewable\_energy}: Renewables, measured as a percentage of equivalent primary energy.
    \item \textbf{high\_min\_wage}: Minimum Wage, measured in USD per month.
    \item \textbf{high\_median\_age}: Median Age, measured in years.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Before integrating the data into the database, we performed several preprocessing steps to clean and transform the data.
This included handling missing values, normalizing the data, and converting categorical variables into numerical values.
Additionaly, the different datasets were merged and integrated into a single database, ensuring that the data was consistent and ready for analysis.
